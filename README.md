# RubyGroups

##Usage
A group, as we all know is a set G and an operation on set. Similarily a Group
in RubyGroups is a finite set with an GroupOperation that is supposed to map
back to it.

In this package, there is a distinction between a representation of an element
and the element itself. For example `1` is a representation of an element in
the group Z/nZ.

The groups `Z(n)` = Z/nZ and `S(n)` the permutations of n elements are
included - the representants of Z(n) are numbers `0..n` and the arrays of
permutations of n elements represent S(n) (eg [0,1,2,3] in S(4) is the
identity and [1,0,2,3] the transposition of (0,1)).

## Interesting operations
### Subgroup
    Z(6).subgroup([2]) =~ [0,2,4]
    Z(5).subgroup([2]) =~ [0,1,2,3,4]

`Group.subgroup([representants])` gives the subgroup that is generated by the
representants. Very handy to check if some elements form a generating system
of a group G.

### neutral
    Z(6).neutral =~ 0

gives the neutral element. Finds out which it is by itself.

### Getting an element
    i = Z(6)[1]
    i*i         =~ 2

Get an element by its representation.

### subgroups
    Z(6).subgroups    =~ Z(6), 2Z(3), 3Z(2), 6Z(1)

Get all subgroups of a group. Waring: is horribly slow

### element order
    Z(6)[1].order      = 6
    Z(6)[2].order      = 3

### element^n
    Z(6)[1]^4          =~ 4
